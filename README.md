## Summary


For corporate purposes we have been asked to provide a blog service so that our engineering team can publish technical articles. We have thought that wordpress is a standard and suitable platform for this purpose.

Could you help us to deploy it in one of our cloud providers?



## What we want ?
Could you please take this service, and deploy it on Azure or AWS in a cool way?

Please, make Infra as Code, we prefer terraform :)

Prepare some diagrams if needed or you think it will help during a technical conversation.

Technically speaking, we need to get:

- Application URL if working
- GitHub repo

## Good to know

- We prefer the deploy process to download a fixed version of your choice from https://wordpress.org/download/releases/
- You can chose any of the available storage/DB alternatives
- High availabilty and scalability is a must

## Nice to have

- logs and tracing
- CI/CD covering upgrade process

Good luck !
